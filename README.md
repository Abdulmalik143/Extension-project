# Browser extension manager UI

ðŸš€ New Project: Extensions

I recently completed a FrontEnd Mentor challenge where I built an interactive web interface using React.js and Tailwind CSS.
Supports Light & Dark Mode.
Uses a local JSON file as a mock database to store and manage extensions.
Provides a clean UI for enabling, disabling, and removing extensions.

This project helped me:

Strengthen my front-end development and responsive design skills.
Practice component-based architecture and state management.
Deliver a polished, modern interface without relying on a live API.
